Project Description: Animal Sound System

Overview:
This project is designed to simulate different animals' sounds. The system allows the creation of various animal objects, each with a unique sound. The project further enhances these animal sounds by modify the sound's intensity. A factory pattern is employed to create animal instances based on user input.

User Interaction:
The user is prompted to enter an animal type (Dog, Dolphin, Lion, or Bird).
The system creates the corresponding animal and produces the animal's sound.
The system allows the user to modify the sound output (loud or soft).
If an invalid animal type is entered, the user is informed, and the system allows for retrying.
